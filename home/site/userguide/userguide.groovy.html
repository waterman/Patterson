    <h2>Quickstart</h2>
    <h3>Structure of resources</h3>
    <p>
    To generate a website using Patterson you organize the files making up your site in in source directory. 
    The layout of the source directory corresponds to the directory structure of the finally generated site. 
    Patterson walks along the source directory and copies the files to a target directory. 
    Files which are recognized as templates are evaluated before copied.
    </p>
    The default directory structure for Patterson is as follows:
    <pre class="sample">
    +--+ site/ <span class="inlineComment">/*default source folder containing the templates and resources*/</span>
       +--+ myFolder1/
          +-- myFile1.groovy.html
          +-- myImage1.gif  
    +--+ build/ <span class="inlineComment">/*default target folder containing the finally generated site*/</span>
       +--+ myFolder1/
          +-- myFile1.html
          +-- myImage1.gif
    +-- build.xml <span class="inlineComment">/*optional ant build file, calling the generator*/</span>
    </pre>
    <h3>Template processing</h3>
    <p>Patterson assumes, that files in the source directory having a name like &lt;filename&gt;.groovy.&lt;extension&gt; 
    are Groovy templates. These templates are evaluated, the ".groovy" part of the filename is removed and the result of the template
    is copied to its corresponding folder in the target folder.
    </p>  
    <h3>Template features</h3>
    <p>
    Groovy templates are a mixture of plain target content and Groovy code. The Groovy code typically adds content dynamically.
    Several helper Objects are available in the context of each template:
    <table class="datatable">
    	<tr class="odd"><th>Variable name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
    	<tr class="even"><td>generator</td><td>The generator object itself, providing access to the entire generator runtime</td></tr>
    	<tr class="odd"><td>templateSupport</td><td>Providing methods usefull for templates</td></tr>
    </table> 
    </p>
